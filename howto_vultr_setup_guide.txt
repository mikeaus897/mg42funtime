- HOWTO Easily deploy dedicated Return to Castle Wolfenstein game server in vultr cloud servers for $2.5 - $6 / month



--- 1. Setting up right Vultr VPS server
login https://my.vultr.com/ and Deploy New Server : Products -> Deploy New Server

Deploy New Instance:
Choose Server -> Cloud Compute
CPU & Storage Technology -> intel High Performance NVMe SSD or Regular Performance regular SSD
Server Location: New York (NJ) or any other location
Server Image -> ISO Library -> Debian Bullseye 11.4 x32
Server Size -> 25 GB NVMe $6/month - 1 vCPU 1 GB Memory 2 TB Bandwidth
Add Auto Backups: OFF
Additional Features: Disable IPv6
Server Hostname & Label -> Enter server hostname: rtcw
                           Enter server label: rtcw
-> Deploy NOW



--- 2. Custom ISO image
Do not choose Debian Bullseye 11.4 x64 in Server Image -> ISO Library, as rtcw gameserver wolfded.x86 library is not design or compiled to work on 64bit operating systems
Alternatively download 32bit debian iso debian-11.4.0-i386-netinst.iso directly from https://www.debian.org
ISO repository link: https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/debian-11.4.0-i386-netinst.iso

goto Vultr -> Products -> ISOs -> Add ISO -> Upload ISO from remote machine: https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/debian-11.4.0-i386-netinst.iso
                                             -> Upload
and choose your Upload ISO -> My ISOs (Manage) during Deploy New Server instance setup



--- 3. Install new Debian OS
goto Products -> Instances -> open newly deployed server -> View Console
and install Debian OS

after installation:
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo reboot

sudo apt install neofetch
sudo apt install htop
sudo apt install mc
sudo apt install nmap
sudo apt install speedtest-cli

check servers hardware information: neofetch
test your newly deployed server speed: sudo speedtest-cli

create a folder wolfserver, copy all repository files into,
goto /wolfserver/rtcwPub folder and edit all gameserver configuration settings .cfg files as required,
edit start.sh and update +set fs_homepath "/root/.wolf" with wolfserver path,

make sure start.sh start script, wolfded.x86 and qagame.mp.i386.so has executable rights,
chmod +x \wolfserver\start.sh
chmod +x \wolfserver\wolfded.x86
chmod +x \wolfserver\rtcwPub\qagame.mp.i386.so

start rtcw gameserver
./start.sh



--- Vultr CPU & Storage Technology
--- NVMe vs Regular SSD performance in RTCW game server explanation
intel High Performance Powered by new generations of Intel Xeon CPUs and NVMe SSD. / High Frequency Powered by 3GHz+ Intel Xeon CPUs and NVMe SSD.
vs
intel Regular Performance Powered by previous generation Intel CPUs and regular SSD.

Choosing right CPU & Storage Technology is important for running proper and better or best rtcw gameserver. Not in the aspect of CPU performance but in VPS servers share storage solution (cloud = shared).
In VPSes servers storage is shared between all running servers on a cloud system infrastructure and is shared in between.
NVMe or not NVMe storage. On vpses its iops does matter because of storage response performance.
RTCW gameserver app (wolfded.x86) is using hungmegs which is moved on linux to Virt instead of Mem which is forced for some reason instead of mem but to virt. Virt is storage temp memory. com_hungMegs memory allocation can be adjusted by +set com_hunkmegs 64 in gameserver starting script start.sh
It can be seen in linux htop application displaying amount of physical memory used on runnings application and Virt memory that application is using.
As summary it is what gameserver performance is expected even for old rtcw gameserver.
