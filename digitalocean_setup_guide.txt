--- 1. Create ESXi Virtual Machine
create esxi vm: 1cpu, 1gb ram, 25gb disk
mount image: debian-11.2.0-i386-netinst.iso
install server only with SSH

start server, log in and install following cloud essentials :
sudo apt install cloud-init (to install cloud-init)
sudo apt install mc         (to install midnight commander, midnight-commander.org)
sudo cloud-init clean       (clean up configuration from the initial cloud-init)
sudo service ssh status     (to check if ssh is installed and working active)
lsblk                       (to see block device arrangement for system and partition arrangement and sizes)
lsb_release -a              (to see operating system version)
hostnamectl                 (to see operating system kernel version
sudo reboot
sudo poweroff


--- 2. Pull VMDK file from ESXi server using WinSCP
in VMware ESXi -> Host -> Actions -> Services -> Enable Secure Shell (SSH)
login to ESXi with WinSCP -> vmfs/volumes/isci.volume.com/debian-11.2.0-i386-netinst - 1/
                             copy debian-11.2.0-i386-netinst - 1-flat.vmdk
rename debian-11.2.0-i386-netinst - 1-flat.vmdk to debian.vmdk


--- 3. Compress debian.vmdk IMAGE to GZ using Total Commander
- https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/images/custom-images/
- notes: can also upload a custom image that meets the above criteria as a compressed gzip or bzip2 file
pack debian.vmdk with TotalCommander to .gz file (Files -> Pack -> GZ -> OK, outcome: debian.vmdk.gz


--- 4. Upload debian.vmdk.gz compressed image to DigitalOcean and add it to DigitalOcean DataCenter regions where want to deploy server
DigitalOcean -> Images -> Custom Image -> upload debian.vmdk.gz
DigitalOcean -> More -> Add to region -> Select the regions that you would like your custom image to be available in.:
                                         NYC1 SFO1 NYC2 NYC3 SFO2 SFO3


--- 5. Create DigitalOcean droplet (DigitalOcean cloud server)
DigitalOcean -> PROJECTS -> mg42funtime sfo -> Create -> Droplets -> debian.vmdk.gz -> Choose a plan: Basic
                                                                     CPU options: Regular Intel with SSD
                                                                     $5/mo 1 GB/1 CPU/25GB SSD Disk/1000GB transfer
                                                                     San Francisco: 3
                                                                     Authentication: SSH keys A more secure authentication method
                                                                     Choose your SSH keys: debian
                                                                     Choose a hostname: debian-1vcpu-1gb-sfo3-01 (default: debian.vmdk.gz-s-1vcpu-1gb-sfo3-01)
DigitalOcean -> PROJECTS -> mg42funtime sfo -> debian-1vcpu-1gb-sfo3-01; SFO3 / 1GB / 25GB Disk


--- 6. To view or edit ssh keys access in DigitalOcean
DigitalOcean -> Settings -> Security -> SSH keys -> Name: debiansshkey
                                                    Fingerprint: 11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:00:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
                                                    -> More -> Edit -> Edit SSH key


--- 7. Create access to server using SSH in Putty
PuTTY -> Host Name: 100.110.120.130
         Saved Sessions: 100.110.120.130 debian-1vcpu-1gb-sfo3-01
         -> Category -> Window -> Columns: 160
                                  Rows: 48
         -> Category -> Connection -> SSH -> Auth -> Browse -> id_rsa.ppk (choose the ssh Putty Private Key File .ppk that will be used to login to server in Digitalocean)
         -> Session -> 100.110.120.130 debian-1vcpu-1gb-sfo3-01 -> Save


--- 8. Create DigitalOcean console access via DigitalOcean website
login to DigitalOcean server with PuTTY -> login as: root -> copy CTRL-C: wget -qO- https://repos-droplet.digitalocean.com/install.sh | sudo bash
                                                          -> right mouse click in the Putty console

after that in
DigitalOcean -> PROJECTS -> mg42funtime sfo -> debian-1vcpu-1gb-sfo3-01 -> Access -> Droplet Console, Log in as... root, Launch Droplet Console
                                                                                     will become available to login and Console will also work to login in via DigitalOcean website directly

Notes: curl -sSL https://repos-droplet.digitalocean.com/install.sh | sudo bash, DOES NOT WORK with Debian

DigitalOcean -> PROJECTS -> mg42funtime sfo -> debian-1vcpu-1gb-sfo3-01 -> Access -> Droplet Console
                curl -sSL https://repos-droplet.digitalocean.com/install.sh | sudo bash
                wget -qO- https://repos-droplet.digitalocean.com/install.sh | sudo bash


--- 9. First things to check and install
login to DigitalOcean server using Putty
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
lsblk                       (to see block device arrangement for system and partition arrangement and sizes are correct)
df / -h                     (to see space available on current partition)
fdisk -l                    (to see main disk and allocated partitions)
ip addr                     (to see server ip address)

sudo apt install mc
sudo apt install htop
sudo apt install nmap          (test: nmap -n -p 1-65000 localhost)
sudo apt install speedtest-cli (test: speedtest-cli)
sudo apt install neotech       (test: neofetch)
sudo apt install screen

sudo apt install make
sudo apt install nasm
sudo apt install gcc


--- 10. Configure WinSCP for file transfer with DigitalOcean
WinSCP -> New Site -> Host name: 100.110.120.130
                      User name: root
                      -> Advanced -> SSH -> Authentication -> Private key file: id_rsa.ppk (choose the ssh Putty Private Key File .ppk that will be used to login to DigitalOcean server)
                                                              -> OK
                                                              -> Save

to change Site name: RMC on 100.110.120.130 -> Rename
to change folders (Remote and Local directory): LMC on 100.110.120.130 -> Advanced -> Directories -> Remote directory: /
                                                                                                     Local directory: c:\wolf
                                                                                                     -> OK -> Save
