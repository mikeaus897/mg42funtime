--- 1. Initial Debian 11.2 Bullseye 32-bit Server setup
using PuTTY, login to Debian server and install following packages with commands below (required to compile gameserver libraries, start and keep RTCW gameserver running later):

sudo apt install make
sudo apt install nasm
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install screen



--- 2. Compile RTCW gameserver executable and game library
download mg42funtime-master.zip source code library on your local computer from https://github.com/mikeaus897/mg42funtime
                                                                                -> Code -> Download ZIP

using WinSCP, login to Debian server and create new folder in server root directory: /wolfcompile
upload mg42funtime-master.zip to this new created folder: /wolfcompile
note: to get RTCW gameserver running you need to compile 2 files: wolfded.x86 (gameserver executable)
                                                                  qagame.mp.i386.so (gameserver library)

using PuTTY, login to server and unzip uploaded source code file mg42funtime-master.zip in /wolfcompile folder and compile source code
cd //
cd /wolfcompile
unzip mg42funtime-master.zip

cd //
cd /wolfcompile/mg42funtime-master/src/unix
make server                                   (to compile rtcw gameserver executable: wolfded.x86, command: make server)

cd //
cd /wolfcompile/mg42funtime-master/src/game
make                                          (to compile rtcw gameserver library: qagame.mp.i386.so, command: make)



--- 3. Setup RTCW gameserver
using WinSCP, create RTCW gameserver folders, and place specific files in specific directories as follows:
/wolf          (min files required: start.sh, wolfded.x86, banned.txt)
/wolf/rtcwPub  (min files required: autoexec.cfg, deathmatch.cfg, GeoIP.dat, highVidlowCPU.cfg, language.cfg, mapsrotation.cfg, objective.cfg, qagame.mp.i386.so, shared.cfg)
/wolf/main     (min files required: mp_pak0.pk3)

using WinSCP
edit deathmatch.cfg and configure game settings as required
edit shared.cfg and configure gameserver settings as required
edit start.sh and configure gameserver folder path: fs_homepath "/wolf"

              - RTCW gameserver folder path notes:
              There are 3 places wolfded.x86 gameserver console it will look for datafiles
              1st: [specified fs_homepath in start script]
              2nd: /home/[user]/.wolf/
              3rd: /usr/local/games/wolfenstein/
              4th: /root/.wolf/   (if as logged in as root)

Dont forget to give start.sh file exec privilages so can be executed as gameserver start script: ./start.sh
cd //
cd /wolf
chmod 777 start.sh



--- 4. Starting RTCW gameserver
using PuTTY, login to your Debian server type following commands:
cd //
cd wolf
screen -> press ENTER
./start.sh                      (RTCW gameserver console will start and will keep running)
press X to close PuTTY terminal (now your rtcw gameserver console is running in Debian server background)



--- 5. Monitoring and testing server performance
sudo apt install speedtest-cli   (test your server optimal bandwidth, command: speedtest-cli)
sudo apt install htop            (monitor server cpu and memory usage anytime, command: htop)
sudo apt install nmap            (view all open server ports access for security, command: nmap -n sT -sU -p 1-65000 localhost)
sudo apt install neofetch        (check Debian server details information, command: neofetch)



--- Additional notes:
--- you can login to Debian server at anytime without interrupting running RTCW gameserver; to monitor, update operating system, check performance, etc.)
screen -r             (to return to RTCW gameserver console screen background session anytime, press X anytime to close PuTTY terminal without interrupting RTCW gameserver running)
reboot                (to reboot server)
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade (to update server and keep it updated and secure)
htop                  (to monitor server cpu performance)
