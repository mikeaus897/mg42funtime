// Map configs are map-specific .cfg files that are executed at the start of every round.
// Place them within a mapconfigs folder that's along-side your executable file, and name them map_name.cfg (i.e. mapconfigs/mp_base.cfg).
// They are primarily useful for objective: changing whether flag retake is enabled for certain maps, and disabled for others (i.e. disable flag retake for mp_base, but enable it for mp_destruction).
